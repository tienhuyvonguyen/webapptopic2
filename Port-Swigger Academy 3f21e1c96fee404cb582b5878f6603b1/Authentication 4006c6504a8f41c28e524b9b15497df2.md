## LAB 00: ****Password brute-force via password change****

### Overall

Noted from instruction that the change passwd function is vulnerable to brute force attack, there are 3 fields in.

If the old passwd is correct but the 2 new passwd fields is incorrect, the blog will warning the 2 new passwd is not match.

If the old passwd is incorrect but 2 new passwd fields is correct, the blog will push the user out of the blog. Return to the login page.

So, we can have a logic of this function, with the first case, we might use this case to perform the attack.

### Step to reproduce

From this step, we will try to capture the request that perform the change passwd function, which is /my-account/change-password, redirect it to intruder.

Edit the request to the similar picture, then use the passwd list from provided from burp and perform the brute force attack.

We expect that the response from the attack that there will be at least 1 response that appear the string “ The password do not match “, which mean the real password from the attack is correct.

Sorted by the length of the response, we can get the correct passwd.

### Mitigation

Fix the logic of the function, may change to the same with the 2nd case, which is automate log out the user out of the blog.

Have a better passwd policy that make the brute force or dictionary attack harder to perform.
