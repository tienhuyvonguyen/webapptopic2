# SSRF

# LAB 00: ****SSRF with blacklist-based input filter****

## Overall

From the instruction, we may noted that the check stock function of the blog is vulnerable, which we will need to focus on this end point first.

We may saw that when we perform the function, its call some kind of outside the blog domain or 3rd party website to perform the function and then return the result of the function to the user.

So, basically, when this function perform, it allow the user to contact to the outside or others domain, server, website.

## Step to reproduce

So, the target of this lab is to take advantage of the vulnerable to access the admin panel then delete Carlos out of the blog.

So, from recon section, we can put domain, website inside the stockAPI, which is some kind of calling outside API function to perform the task in this blog.

Noted in here, when we specified the IP, there are some mechanism that defense again SSRF, so we may think about other way that can bypass the defense.

Luckily, alternative IP representation is one of the good way to give a shoot.

We may seen the difference between 2 request and response.

At this time, we can append the others page inside the main page. Next we want to go to admin panel and delete Carlos.

But defense is again effective, so we need to find 1 more way to bypass this kind of defense.

After try with many encode, URL double encode have an effect over the response.

Then 1 again, we trigger the payload by specified the url that perform the SSRF attack over Carlos to delete him, double url encode it.
